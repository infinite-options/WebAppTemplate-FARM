## Database Template - MySQL
This directory holds a script for a sample database schema for the application template.

### Database Setup
To set up the MySQL instance, follow these steps:
1. Create and connect to a MySQL database instance. The most common ways to do this are with MySQL Workbench or `mysql` on the Linux command line interface.
2. Run `sample.sql` within the instance. It will create a schema called `SampleInventory` and then initialize a table called `Inventory`.
